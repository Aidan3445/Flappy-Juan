# Python-AI
Making a flappy bird AI in python.

Flappy Juan can be run from Main.py script with some command-line arguments to change
various parameters for both playing and training.

## Flappy Juan
Flappy Juan is a Flappy Bird game I made for my roommate's birthday using his 
head as the "bird" and my girlfriend as the "pipes".

I initially made the game for in DrRacket (Beginner), the language we used in my
Fundies 1 course at Northeastern. Eventually, I wanted to teach myself Python,
specifically UI in Python. I decided I wanted to rewrite the game using the pygame 
library. Shortly after doing so, I followed along with a [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0)
tutorial and explanation for making your own basic Neural Networks and I wanted something
to apply it to and came back to my previous code for Flappy Juan. I enjoyed seeing this
project evolve over the different phases, and I'm proud of the final product.
