# Flappy Juan - A Python AI Project
Introduction
Flappy Juan is a project that combines elements of a popular mobile game, Flappy Bird, with artificial intelligence. This Python-based game allows you to run an AI that controls the "bird" character, and you can even watch the AI's best performances.

## Running Flappy Juan
You can run Flappy Juan from the Main.py script, and it supports various command-line arguments to modify both gameplay and training parameters. Here are some key features:

Pressing the space bar toggles the display of the best saved Juan, if it exists.
In training mode, you can change the training speed by pressing the numbers 1-4 on your keyboard.

## The Story Behind Flappy Juan

Flappy Juan was originally created as a birthday gift for my roommate. It adds a unique twist to the Flappy Bird concept by using my roommate's head as the "bird" character and my girlfriend as the "pipes."

## Development Journey

1. **DrRacket (Beginner)**: Initially, I created the game using DrRacket, a beginner-friendly programming language. I did this during my Fundies 1 course at Northeastern University.

2. **Transition to Python**: At some point, I decided to teach myself Python, specifically focusing on user interface (UI) development. As a result, I rewrote the game using the pygame library, a popular Python library for developing games.

3. **Introduction to Neural Networks**: After gaining proficiency in Python and UI development, I explored the world of neural networks. I followed a [Coding Train tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0) that explained how to create basic neural networks. This newfound knowledge inspired me to apply it to my Flappy Juan project.

4. **AI Integration**: I returned to my Flappy Juan code and integrated the AI component. The AI controls the bird character, attempting to navigate through the pipes, showcasing the bird's "intelligence" in making decisions.

5. **Proud of the Result**: The project evolved over different phases, and I'm proud of the final product. It's a testament to my journey in programming and my ability to create a unique and entertaining game.

Flappy Juan is not just a game but also a reflection of my growth as a programmer and my ability to bring creativity to my projects. It combines the fun of a classic game with the excitement of AI experimentation, making it a unique and enjoyable project.
