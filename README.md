## Flappy Juan
Making a flappy bird AI in python.

Flappy Juan can be run from Main.py script with some command-line arguments to change
various parameters for both playing and training. 
Pressing the space bar will toggle showing the best saved Juan if it exists. 
In training mode you can toggle between four training speeds by pressing the numbers 1-4 on your keyboard.

Flappy Juan is a Flappy Bird game I made for my roommate's birthday using his 
head as the "bird" and my girlfriend as the "pipes".

I initially made the game for in DrRacket (Beginner), the language we used in my
Fundies 1 course at Northeastern. Eventually, I wanted to teach myself Python,
specifically UI in Python. I decided I wanted to rewrite the game using the pygame 
library. Shortly after doing so, I followed along with a [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0)
tutorial and explanation for making your own basic Neural Networks and I wanted something
to apply it to and came back to my previous code for Flappy Juan. I enjoyed seeing this
project evolve over the different phases, and I'm proud of the final product.
